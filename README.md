# latent-dirichlet-allocation
This project uses latent dirichlet allocation for topic modeling. It first generates the document term matrix. Then it builds the latent dirichlet allocation algorithm to extract latent topics in the documents. A wordcloud function is also implemented to display the representative words of each topics.
